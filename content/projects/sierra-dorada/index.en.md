In 2024 the Tomi Fennell foundation worked with [Fundación Sierra Dorada](http://www.sierradorada.com.ar/) to expand the solar energy system they were running at their children's shelter. The shelter, founded in November 2000, is located in San Marcos Sierras, Córdoba, Argentina.

[Iris Energía](https://irisenergia.com.ar/) custom-built an aluminum structure to add [8 solar
panels](https://www.jinkosolar.com/uploads/TR%20JKM450-470M-7RL3-(V)-C1-EN.pdf) to the existing system. This added 3760
Watts of generation power. Additionally, a new
[inverter](https://growatt.tech/product/growatt-mic-3000-tl-x-1-phase-inverter/) was connected to the system in order to
manage the additional power.
