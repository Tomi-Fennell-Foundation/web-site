The foundation was first initiated by Graciana Rodríguez on behalf of her son Tomi Fennell, who died in
a traffic accident in Vermont, USA. Tomi had a dream to help communities in need so that they would be
able to generate their own renewable energy, and in this way their children would grow up with an
understanding of and commitment to sustainability.

Graciana, together with family and friends, began to raise funds and aligning herself with the
company Iris Energy (based in Córdoba, Argentina), took on the challenge to make Tomi’s dream a reality.
Together they committed to helping communities in need that lack the resources needed to install their
own sources of renewable energy.

Our work is based on charitable actions that will help cover the energy needs of these communities.
It will be done in collaboration with the communities' leaders and other entities or people that share
the same objective.
