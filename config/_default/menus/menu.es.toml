# This file is the Spanish menu configuration file. Its English counterpart is
# menu.en.toml, which is a symlink to this file because both files have exactly
# the same content. This is necessary because Hugo does not support
# language-specific menus (or I didn't find a way to do it).
#
# Modify this file to change the menu structure of the site. Do not mess with
# menu.en.toml unless you intend to have different menus for the different
# languages.
